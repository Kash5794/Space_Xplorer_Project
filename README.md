# How to setup, start, and use this application

## Setup Fundamental Requirements:
-Install Node JS - javascript runtime engine (see here for more info [https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs]). \
-Install your favorite code editor e.g vscode. \
-Open the project in your code editor and navigate to frontend sub-directory. \
-Type the command `npm install` in the terminal to install all packages in the package.json file. \
-Navigate to the backend sub-directory to do the same npm installation.\ 
-Create a .env file in the backend directory and enter the following.\
    --API_KEY='replace with your NASA API key' (see here on how to create this: [https://api.nasa.gov/]).\
   --OPEN_AI_KEY = 'Replace with your OpenAI API key' [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys].\

Now, that everything is set, let us launch the app.\



## Launching the app locally
`cd` to the backend directory if not already there.\
From your terminal, type `npm start`.\
Well done if you can see `Server is listening on port -----` in your terminal.\
Open a browser and type [http://localhost:3001].\
Now your NodeJS app is up and running in the browser.\
